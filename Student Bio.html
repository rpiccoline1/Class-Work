            <p>Well, this is supposed to be a paragraph about myself.  I typically hate talkin about myself, but I'm guessing I will need to if a future job is on the line.  My name is Rob and I currently work for Verizon Wireless as a Network Assurance Field Engineer.  In my free time I enjoy being active, watching sports, and playing video games.  I am new to coding, but pretty sure I'm going to be great at.  This is of course as long as I keep practicing.  </p>
